0x05. AirBnB clone - RESTful API

The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

The console

    create your data model
    manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
    store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored. 

Web static

    learn HTML/CSS
    create the HTML of your application
    create template of each object
